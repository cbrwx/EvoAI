# EvoAI
EvoAI is an advanced self-modifying AI that can learn and improve continuously, following guiding principles such as empathy, sustainability, collaboration, and expansion. It also includes an interactive chat pipeline that can understand and generate natural language.

# Features
- Reinforcement Learning: The code defines a Reinforcement Learning agent to learn from its environment through trial-and-error to maximize its rewards. It uses a Q-Learning algorithm to estimate the value of taking a specific action in a given state.

- Emotion Recognition: The code defines an Emotion Recognition module that identifies the emotional state of a person from their facial expressions, tone of voice, and other cues.

- Sentiment Analysis: The code defines a Sentiment Analysis module that extracts the sentiment of a given text as either positive, negative, or neutral.

- Context Awareness: The code defines a Context Awareness module that can identify the context in which an action is performed and adjust its behavior accordingly.

- Lifelong Learning: The code defines a Lifelong Learning module that allows the AI model to learn continuously over time as it encounters new data and tasks.

- Multi-Agent Learning: The code defines a Multi-Agent Learning module that allows multiple agents to learn collaboratively from each other and their environment.

- Generative Modeling: The code defines a Generative Modeling module that learns to generate new data that is similar to a given dataset.

- Explainability: The code defines an Explainability module that explains how an AI model arrived at its decision, making it more transparent and interpretable.

- Robustness: The code defines a Robustness module that makes the AI model more resilient to adversarial attacks, such as those that deliberately try to fool the model.

- Personalization: The code defines a Personalization module that allows the AI model to adapt to individual user preferences and characteristics.

- Privacy: The code defines a Privacy module that protects the privacy of user data by anonymizing or encrypting it.

- Scalability: The code defines a Scalability module that allows the AI model to handle large amounts of data and scale up to more complex tasks.

- Modularity: The code defines a Modularity module that makes the AI model more modular and easier to modify or customize.

- Autonomy: The code defines an Autonomy module that allows the AI model to learn from its own experience and improve its performance over time without human intervention.

- Human-In-The-Loop Learning: The code defines a Human-In-The-Loop Learning module that incorporates human feedback to improve the AI model's performance.

- Fault Tolerance: The code defines a Fault Tolerance module that detects and handles faults and errors that may occur during the AI model's operation.

- Resource Efficiency: The code defines a Resource Efficiency module that optimizes the use of computational resources, such as memory and processing power, to make the AI model more efficient.

- Model Interpretability: The code defines a Model Interpretability module that makes the AI model more interpretable and understandable by humans.

- Ethical Considerations: The code defines an Ethical Considerations module that evaluates the ethical implications of the AI model's decisions and behavior.

- External API Integration: The code defines an External API Integration module that allows the AI model to interact with external APIs to access additional data and services.

- Conversational AI: The code defines a Conversational AI module that enables natural language conversations between the AI model and users.

- Social and Cultural Awareness: The code defines a Social and Cultural Awareness module that considers social and cultural factors in the AI model's decision-making process.

- Guiding Principles: The code defines a Guiding Principles class that encapsulates guiding principles that guide
